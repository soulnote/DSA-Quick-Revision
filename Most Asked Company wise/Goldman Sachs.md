Goldman Sachs SDE technical interviews, similar to other top tech companies, focus on data structures and algorithms, often with a mix of difficulty levels. Over the last year, common themes and specific problems have emerged. It's important to note that interviews also heavily weigh on **core computer science fundamentals (OS, OOPS, DBMS, Networking)** and **system design** (especially for experienced roles). Puzzles and aptitude questions are also common.

Here's a breakdown of frequently reported LeetCode problems and types, categorized for clarity:

**1. Core Data Structures & Algorithms (Most Frequent):**

* **Arrays:**
    * **Two Sum** (Easy/Medium) - Classic, often used to check understanding of Hash Maps.
    * **Merge Sorted Arrays** (Easy/Medium) - Fundamental sorting/merging.
    * **Segregate 0s and 1s / Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s** (Dutch National Flag Problem) (Medium)
    * **Trapping Rain Water** (Hard) - A very common and challenging array problem.
    * **Kth Largest Element in an Array** (Medium) - Often solved with Quickselect or a Min-Heap.
    * **Maximum Subarray** (Kadane's Algorithm) (Medium)
    * **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** (Medium) - Sliding window.
    * **Product of Array Except Self** (Medium)
    * **Find Duplicate in an Array of N integers** (Medium - can have tricky efficient solutions)
    * **Subarray Product Less Than K** (Medium - sliding window)

* **Linked Lists:**
    * **Reverse Linked List** (Easy) - Fundamental.
    * **Reverse Linked List in blocks of K** (e.g., Reverse elements in blocks of two: `7 -> 4 -> 9 -> 2 -> Null` becomes `4 -> 7 -> 2 -> 9 -> Null`) (Medium)
    * **Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome** (Medium) - Can have constraints on space.
    * **Add Two Numbers** (Medium)
    * **Copy List with Random Pointer** (Medium)
    * **Linked List Cycle / Cycle II** (Easy/Medium)

* **Strings:**
    * **First Unique Character in a String** (Easy)
    * **Group Anagrams** (Medium)
    * **Reverse Words in a String** (Medium)
    * **Reduce string by removing K consecutive identical characters** (Medium - often uses a stack)
    * **Find all Anagrams in a String** (Medium - Sliding Window)

* **Trees:**
    * **Validate Binary Search Tree** (Medium)
    * **Kth Smallest Element in a BST** (Medium)
    * **Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree** (Medium)

* **Graphs:**
    * **Number of Islands** (Medium) - DFS/BFS.
    * **Course Schedule** (Medium) - Topological Sort.
    * **Max path sum in matrix going from top left to bottom right** (similar to Minimum Path Sum, but for max sum) (Medium - DP/DFS + Memoization)
    * **Lake Counting on a Grid** (Hard - variation of Number of Islands)

* **Dynamic Programming (DP):**
    * **Coin Change / Coin Change 2** (Medium)
    * **Minimum Path Sum** / **Maximum Path Sum in a Grid** (Medium)
    * **Fibonacci Number** (Easy - often asked for optimized approaches beyond naive recursion)
    * **Stock Buy and Sell (Max One Transaction, Max Two Transactions)** (Easy/Medium)

* **Hash Maps / Sets:**
    * **Design HashMap** (Easy/Medium) - Understanding internal working.
    * **LRU Cache** (Medium/Hard) - A frequently asked design-oriented problem combining Hash Map and Doubly Linked List.
    * **LFU Cache** (Hard) - Less frequent than LRU, but possible.

* **Heaps / Priority Queues:**
    * **Find Median from Data Stream** (Hard) - Using two heaps.
    * **K Closest Points to Origin** (Medium)

**2. Design & System-Oriented Problems:**

* **Design Parking Lot** (LLD/HLD) - A very common system design question.
* **Design a stock buy/sell trading system** (HLD - involves real-time data, concurrency, etc.)
* **Design an In-Memory File System** (Hard - data structure design)
* **Implement multiple stacks in one array.**
* **Thread-safe Circular Buffer** (Hard - Concurrency concepts)

**3. Puzzles & Aptitude:**

Goldman Sachs is known for asking logical puzzles in interviews. Examples include:
* Three ants in corners of a triangle puzzle.
* The 4 people, bridge, and one torch puzzle.
* 100 gold coins and 5 pirates puzzle.
* Weighing 9 balls puzzle.

**4. Core CS Concepts & OOPS:**

Beyond LeetCode, be prepared for in-depth questions on:
* **Operating Systems:** Processes vs. Threads, Race Conditions, Deadlock, Mutexes, Semaphores, Memory Management, Garbage Collection (especially for Java).
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction), Abstract Class vs. Interface, Method Overloading/Overriding, Static methods, Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.).
* **Databases (DBMS):** SQL queries (joins, indexing), ACID properties, Normalization.
* **Networking:** RESTful Web Services, HTTP methods, TCP/IP.
* **SDLC/Agile Methodologies**

**General Advice for Goldman Sachs Interviews:**

* **Mix of Difficulty:** Expect a range from Easy to Hard LeetCode problems. They assess your problem-solving approach, ability to optimize, and handle edge cases.
* **Conceptual Understanding:** They highly value strong fundamental knowledge of computer science concepts, not just rote memorization of LeetCode solutions.
* **Communication:** Clearly explain your thought process, justify your choices, discuss trade-offs (time/space complexity), and ask clarifying questions.
* **Coding Style:** Write clean, well-structured, and readable code.
* **Behavioral Questions:** Be ready to discuss your projects, challenges, teamwork, and reasons for joining Goldman Sachs. Their "culture fit" is important.
