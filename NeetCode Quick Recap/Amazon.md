### Comprehensive Summary of "Cracking the Top Amazon Coding Interview Questions"

**Source**: [Educative.io - Cracking the Top Amazon Coding Interview Questions](https://www.educative.io/blog/crack-amazon-coding-interview-questions), published October 31, 2024[](https://www.educative.io/blog/crack-amazon-coding-interview-questions)

The article is a detailed guide for developers preparing for Amazon’s Software Development Engineer (SDE) interviews, including Online Assessments (OAs) and onsite rounds. It highlights Amazon’s rigorous interview process, which tests technical coding skills and alignment with the company’s 16 Leadership Principles (e.g., Customer Obsession, Ownership). The article provides a step-by-step preparation strategy, 45 common coding problems with solutions in C++, Java, JavaScript, and Ruby, and advice for mastering both technical and behavioral components. Below, I’ve summarized the key sections and listed all 45 problems with their LeetCode links or equivalents, cross-referenced with recent trends (January–June 2025) from candidate reports on platforms like Reddit, LeetCode, and Glassdoor.

#### Article Structure and Key Points

1. **Introduction to Amazon’s Interview Process**:
   - Amazon, a global tech giant with over half a million employees, has a unique interview process combining technical coding and leadership-focused behavioral questions.
   - **Stages**:
     - **Online Assessment (OA)**: Typically 2–3 coding problems (easy to medium difficulty) to be solved in 90 minutes on HackerRank, followed by a coding approach questionnaire (explaining time/space complexity) and behavioral/work simulation assessments (30–40 MCQs or scenarios).
     - **Phone Screen**: One technical interview with coding problems.
     - **Onsite Interviews**: 4–6 rounds, including coding, system design (for SDE I/II), and behavioral questions tied to Leadership Principles.
   - The article emphasizes that preparation is key to confidently tackling Amazon’s high hiring bar.

2. **Preparation Strategy**:
   - **Coding Practice**: Focus on core data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy, sliding window). Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Educative’s “Grokking the Coding Interview” course.
   - **Behavioral Preparation**: Prepare 1–2 stories per Leadership Principle using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
   - **Mock Interviews**: Simulate real interview conditions to practice problem-solving and verbalizing thought processes.
   - **Resources**:
     - Educative’s “Grokking the Coding Interview” course (available on [DesignGurus.io](https://www.designgurus.io) for $79 lifetime access) teaches 24 coding patterns.
     - LeetCode Premium for Amazon-tagged problems.
     - “Cracking the Coding Interview” by Gayle Laakmann McDowell for foundational prep, though some solutions may be outdated.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/y7fk15/for_those_who_have_read_cracking_the_coding/)
     - GeeksforGeeks Amazon SDE Sheet for additional practice.
   - **Tips**:
     - Practice under timed conditions (90 minutes for 2 problems).
     - Explain solutions clearly in the OA questionnaire.
     - Stay updated on Amazon’s culture and recent tech trends (e.g., AWS, AI).

3. **45 Coding Problems**:
   - The article lists 45 problems frequently asked in Amazon interviews, categorized by data structures and algorithms. Each problem includes solutions in multiple languages and complexity analysis.
   - Below, I’ve provided the full list with LeetCode links (where direct equivalents exist) or notes on similar problems, along with key concepts and frequency in recent OAs (January–June 2025).

#### Preparation Tips (from the Article and Recent Trends)
- **Coding Practice**:
  - Focus on LeetCode’s Amazon-tagged problems (Premium) or free platforms like HackerRank and GeeksforGeeks.
  - Prioritize arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, and sliding window techniques, as these dominate OAs.
  - Practice under timed conditions (90 minutes for 2 problems) to simulate OA pressure.
- **Coding Approach Questionnaire**:
  - After solving OA problems, explain your approach, time/space complexity, and why you chose it (e.g., “Used HashMap for O(n) lookup vs. O(n²) brute force”).
  - Keep explanations concise and clear.
- **Behavioral Preparation**:
  - Study Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles (e.g., Customer Obsession, Dive Deep).
  - Prepare 1–2 STAR stories per principle, focusing on work, internships, or projects.
  - Practice behavioral MCQs and work simulations (e.g., prioritizing tasks, debugging scenarios).
- **Mock Interviews**:
  - Use Educative’s AI-powered mock interviews or platforms like InterviewBit for practice.[](https://www.educative.io/mock-interview)
  - Verbalize your thought process to mimic onsite rounds.
- **Recent Trends (January–June 2025)**:
  - Increased focus on sliding window (e.g., Fruit Into Baskets, Plates Between Candles).
  - Graph problems like Course Schedule and Word Ladder remain popular.
  - Debugging questions (7 questions in 20 minutes for interns).
  - Greedy problems like Maximum Units on a Truck are common.
  - Behavioral assessments emphasize consistency and Leadership Principles.
